# Pokemon game
Myself and two of my classmates created this game for our C++ final project during our 3rd semester. At the end of the day, it turned out fine. It's nothing I'm super jazzed about, but it's functional.
I spent most of my work for this project designing a system that would make adding new characters to the game really simple and robust. 
Unfortunately, it took so long to do that that we didn't actually add many characters to the game.
Overall I'm happy with the code that I wrote, I just wish that I had written some more and that the game's mechanics were more interesting.
/nThe game only runs in QT creator as of right now.
