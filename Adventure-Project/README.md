# Adventure Project
My friend Caleb Knorr and I made this as our final project for our freshman year Python class. We got a little bit excited, and may have bitten off a little more than we could chew, but we did our best to chew it all.
It isn't "finished" per se, but it should be functional and especially if you dive into the code itself you should be able to see all of the content we created for it.
As a whole I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. The enemies feel really different and you have to think about what moves you do when.
