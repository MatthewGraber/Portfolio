Basic mechanics:
  Three stats: HP, stamina, magicka
    Stamina regenerates quickly, magicka regens slowly
  Action system: Action bonus action OR three small actions
  Basic actions:
    Swap weapons
    Dodge?
    Strike (uses stamina)
    Cast spell (uses magicka)
    Rest? (Regain stamina)
    Channel? (Regain magicka)
  
  Defense: Armor Class (AC) AKA difficulty to be hit
    Determines the percentage chance that you are hit by an attack
  Weapons: each weapon has the following values:
    Hit chance
    Damage
    Hands required
    Off-hand attack?
    (Relevant to Fighters only)
      Trip chance
      Shove chance
      Disarm chance
      Block value (AC boost?)
      Counter chance (If you are missed, chance to hit with counterattack)
    Spells:
      Each spell can be cast at higher levels, but the higher level you cast the higher the chance of failure

Three archetypes: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard
  Each should have passive and active abilities

  Fighter:
    Focuses on martial prowess. Has the most stamina and hit points.
    Manuvers: Trip, shove, disarm, block, counter
    
  Rogue:
    Focuses on stealth and attacks that inflict conditions. Medium stamina and HP, low magicka
    Each creature has weak points, and the rogue can specify where it hits it's target
    
  Wizard:
    Focuses on magic. High magicka, low in other stats
    Learns more spells to begin with, can 'upcast' more easily

Story stuff:
  2-3 recurring NPCs with reputation
  Location reputation, bounty hunters?
  Boblin betrayal? Hee-how!
  Some sort of BBEG has threatened to take over the world
 
 Area progression:
  3 areas? More than this seems time consuming
  10? possible encounters in each area, 1 for each NPC?, 1-2 mandatory (Boss fight?), plus misc
  5? encounters happen per area
  10? encounters that fit anywhere
  This means 40 total encounters. That's a lot of work
