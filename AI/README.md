# Tic-Tac-Toe AI
For my AI midterm, we were required to make an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two different versions of this AI: one that uses a heuristic, and another that uses a Monte-Carlo algorithm.
The heuristic version looks at all of the avilable moves and assigns each one a score based on how good it thinks the move is, then chooses the move with the highest score.
The Monte-Carlo version plays out the game randomly a bunch of times, and sees how often it wins, loses, and ties for each move it can take. 
Based on that data, it chooses the move it thinks will give it the highest chance of winning.
