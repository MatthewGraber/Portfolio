# Platformer game
This is a prototype for a game my friend Caleb Knorr and I never finished. We started this project late fall of 2021 and worked on it casually for about 6 weeks. 
We made it for a coding club we were in at our school, but the club has since died down. 
Currently, we have very rudimentary physics such as momentum and object collision functioning.
