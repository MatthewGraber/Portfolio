# Platformer game
This is a prototype for a game my friend Caleb Knorr and I never finished. We started this project late fall of 2021 and worked on it casually for about 6 weeks. 
We made it for a coding club we were in at our school, but the club has since died down. 
Currently, we have very rudimentary physics such as momentum and object collision functioning.

Making this code run required installing some libraries in a way that was unecessarily complicated, and it won't run outside of our QT editor that has all the proper libraries installed, so you probably won't get it to work on your own. If you want to try to go through the atrocious process yourself, we used [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) to run our graphical interface.
